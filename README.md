# Integration Service

The *eProsima Integration Service* is a tool that enables communication among an arbitrary number of protocols that speak different languages.

These protocols are integrated within the *Integration Service* by means of dedicated plugins or *System Handles*.
Currently, we support the following protocols:

* [Fast DDS System Handle](https://github.com/eProsima/FastDDS-SH)

* [ROS 1 System Handle](https://github.com/eProsima/ROS1-SH)

* [ROS 2 System Handle](https://github.com/eProsima/ROS2-SH)

* [WebSocket System Handle](https://github.com/eProsima/WebSocket-SH)

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://integration-service.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/).
