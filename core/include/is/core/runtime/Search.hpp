/**
 * @class Search
 * @brief
 *        This class searches for *Integration Service* message/service plugin
 *        resource files, called MiddlewareInterfaceExtension (.mix) files.
 *
 *        These files will be searched based on a fixed lookup scheme.
 *        This lookup scheme comprises two phases:
 *
 *        * First, it searchs based on the middleware prefixes `mw_prefix`.
 *        * Second, it searchs based on the *Integration Service* prefixes `<is_prefix>`.
 *
 *        The middleware prefixes and *Integration Service* prefixes can be
 *        passed in as command line arguments or set as environment variables.
 *        Command line arguments will take precedence over environment variables.
 *        The environment variable named `IS_PREFIX_PATH` will be added to the
 *        *Integration Service* prefixes `<is_prefix>`, and
 *        `IS_<MIDDLEWARE_NAME>_PREFIX_PATH` will be added to the middleware prefixes
 *        `mw_prefix`. The environment variables should be a colon-separated
 *        list of absolute paths.
 *
 *        Additionally, the contents of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable will be added to
 *        the *Integration Service* prefixes `<is_prefix>`, because the *resource*
 *        directory is expected to be inside a *lib* directory.
 *        Finally, `/usr/local/lib/<arch>`, `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/lib/<arch>`,
 *        and `/usr/lib` will be added to the *Integration Service* prefixes
 *        `<is_prefix>` in this same order of precedence.
 *
 *        **Lookup Scheme**
 *
 *        The lookup scheme is described below, where `mw_prefix` and `<is_prefix>`
 *        are defined above. `<middleware>` refers to the name of the middleware (as
 *        given to the constructor of the Search class). `type` is the type name of
 *        the message or service. In cases of ROS `<msg|srv|*>`, messages will use `msg`
 *        while services use `srv`; when searching for things other than messages or services,
 *        a custom string can be substituted for *.
 *
 *        * `<mw_prefix>/<msg|srv|*>/<type>.mix`
 *        * `<mw_prefix>/<type>.mix`
 *        * `<is_prefix>/<middleware>/<msg|srv|*>/<type>.mix`
 *        * `<is_prefix>/<middleware>/<type>.mix`
 *        * `<is_prefix>/is/<middleware>/<msg|srv|*>/<type>.mix`
 *        * `<is_prefix>/is/<middleware>/<type>.mix`
 *
 *        The `type` value will usually look like *package_name/MessageType*. Any
 *        slashes within the `type` name will be used as a directory delimiters while searching.
 *
 *        **Lookup Pattern**
 *
 *        Similarly, the lookup pattern for the base *Integration Service* middleware interface
 *        extension file `(<middleware>.mix)` will be:
 *
 *        * `<mw_prefix>/<middleware>.mix`
 *        * `<is_prefix>/<middleware>.mix`
 *        * `<is_prefix>/is/<middleware>.mix`
 *        * `<is_prefix>/is/<middleware>/<middleware>.mix`
