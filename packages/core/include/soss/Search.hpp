/// \brief This class searches for soss message/service plugin resource files,
/// called Middleware Interface eXtension (.mix) files.
///
/// These files will be searched for based on a fixed lookup scheme. This lookup
/// scheme has two phases:
///
/// 1. Search based on the middleware prefixes <mw_prefix>
/// 2. Search based on the soss prefixes <soss_prefix>
///
/// The middleware prefixes and soss prefixes can be passed in as command line
/// arguments or set as environment variables. Command line arguments will take
/// precedence over environment variables. The environment variable named
/// SOSS_PREFIX_PATH will be added to the soss prefixes <soss_prefix>, and
/// SOSS_<MIDDLEWARE_NAME>_PREFIX_PATH will be added to the middleware prefixes
/// <mw_prefix>. The environment variables should be a colon-separated list of
/// absolute paths.
///
/// Additionally the contents of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable will be added to
/// the soss prefixes <soss_prefix>, because the soss/ resource directory is
/// expected to be inside a lib directory. Finally, /usr/local/lib/<arch>,
/// /usr/local/lib, /usr/lib/<arch>, and /usr/lib will be added to the soss
/// prefixes <soss_prefix> in that order of precedence.
///
/// The search scheme is described below, where <mw_prefix> and <soss_prefix>
/// are defined above. <middleware> refers to the name of the middleware (as
/// given to the constructor of the Search class). <type> is the type name of
/// the message or service. In cases of <msg|srv|*>, messages will use msg while
/// services use srv; when searching for things other than messages or services,
/// a custom string can be substituted for *.
///
/// 1. <mw_prefix>/<msg|srv|*>/<type>.mix
/// 2. <mw_prefix>/<type>.mix
/// 3. <soss_prefix>/<middleware>/<msg|srv|*>/<type>.mix
/// 4. <soss_prefix>/<middleware>/<type>.mix
/// 5. <soss_prefix>/soss/<middleware>/<msg|srv|*>/<type>.mix
/// 6. <soss_prefix>/soss/<middleware>/<type>.mix
///
/// The <type> value will usually look like package_name/MessageType. Any
/// slashes within the <type> name will be used as a directory delimiters while
/// searching.
///
/// Similarly, the search pattern for the base soss middleware interface
/// extension file (<middleware>.mix) will be:
///
/// 1. <mw_prefix>/<middleware>.mix
/// 2. <soss_prefix>/<middleware>.mix
/// 3. <soss_prefix>/soss/<middleware>.mix
/// 4. <soss_prefix>/soss/<middleware>/<middleware>.mix
