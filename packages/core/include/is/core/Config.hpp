     *
     *          1. `types`: Specifies the `IDL` types used by *Integration Service*

     *             `eprosima::xtypes` parser for `IDL` files, and the resulting
     *             *Dynamic Types* will be added to the available types database.
     *
     *             The following subsections are permitted:
     *
     *             1.1. `idl`: IDL content.
     *             1.2. `paths`: includes paths containing IDL definitions that will
     *                  also be parsed and added to the types database.
     *
     *          2. `systems`: Lists the middlewares involved in the communication,
     *             allowing to configure them. Custom aliases can be given to any system.
     *
     *             The following subsections are permitted:
     *
     *             2.1. `type`: to be selected among the middlewares supported by
     *                  *Integration Service*: `ros2`, `dds`, `websocket`, `ros1`...
     *             2.2. `types-from`: allows to inherit type definitions from one
     *                  system to another. In this way, users do not have to redefine
     *                  types for each system.
     *             2.3. Custom configuration parameters, such as `domain_id` (for ROS 2).
     *                  Each SystemHandle may define its own configuration fields,
     *                  please refer to their documentation for more details.
     *
     *          3. `routes`: Lists the communication bridges that *Integration Service*
     *             needs to establish among `systems`. Each route has a specific name.
     *
     *             The following subsections are permitted:
     *
     *             3.1. `from/to`: publisher/subscriber communication.
     *             3.2. `server/clients`: server/client communication.
     *
     *          4. `topics/services`: Allows to configure the topics exchanged over the `routes`
     *             described above, in either publisher/subscriber or client/server
     *             communication, and provides detailed information about them.
     *             Each topic or service must have a unique name in the `YAML` file.
     *
     *             The following subsections are permitted:
     *
     *             4.1. `type`: Type involved in the communication. It can be a built-in
     *                   type, usually coming from a `mix` library; or a custom user-defined
     *                   type, by means of an IDL definition.
     *             4.2. `route`: Communication bridge, of the ones defined above, that must
     *                  perform the communication.
     *             4.3. `remap`: allows to establish equivalences between `topic` names and
     *                           `types` for each system involved in the communication.
     *             4.4. Custom configuration parameters, which are specific for each middleware.
